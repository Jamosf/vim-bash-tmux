# Code Analysis Patterns

## Structural Patterns

- **MVC Pattern**: Look for models/, views/, controllers/ directories
- **Layered Architecture**: Separate presentation, business logic, data access layers
- **Microservices**: Independent services with APIs

## Code Patterns

- **Factory Pattern**: Classes with create() methods
- **Observer Pattern**: Event subscription mechanisms
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstractions

## Anti-patterns

- **God Object**: Large classes with multiple responsibilities
- **Spaghetti Code**: Tightly coupled, hard to follow code
- **Code Duplication**: Repeated code blocks

## Analysis Techniques

- Use LSP symbols to understand hierarchies
- Trace imports for dependencies
- Look for configuration files for architecture clues
